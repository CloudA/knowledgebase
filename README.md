Install Locally
---------------

0. Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) **v0.10+**.
1. Check out the Cloud-A knowledgebase project
2. run `npm install` to install the node dependencies
3. To start Raneto, run `npm start`
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser

Note: When running on a live site you'll want to set the `PORT` env variable to `80` so you don't need to add `:3000` to the URL.
